I'm really gratefull that very knowldgeble guys have shared their research and projects in github and forums.

This project was inspired in those projects:

 - https://github.com/entrocode/SmartDSC
 - https://github.com/isriam/smartthings-alarmserver/
 - https://github.com/kholloway/smartthings-dsc-alarm
 - https://github.com/yracine/DSC-Integration-with-Arduino-Mega-Shield-RS-232


History
-------
This is just one more variant available to make your DSCAlarm system Smart with SmartThings.

The majority of those amazing projects available are using EnvisaLink board. If you already have one I suggest to you to use one of them.

My favority project is the one using Arduino but unfortunately the SmartThing Shield is deprecated and no longer available in the market.

I already have the DSC IT-100 board for that reason I decided to use it.

The project is on top of Raspberry Pi running NodeJS and SmartThings REST API.
