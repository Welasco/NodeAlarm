I'm really gratefull that very knowldgeble guys have shared their research and projects in github and forums.

This project was inspired in those projects:

History
-------
This is just one more variant available to make your DSCAlarm system Smart with SmartThings.

The majority of those amazing projects available are using EnvisaLink board.

My favority project is the one that implement using Arduino but unfortunately the SmartThing Shield is deprecated and no longer available in the market.

I already have the DSC IT-100 board it doesn't make sence buy another one just to make it work.

For that reason I decided to implement using a Raspberry Pi running NodeJS and SmartThings REST API.

Prerequisites
